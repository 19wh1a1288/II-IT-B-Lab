## Aim of the experiment:
Write a program that use both recursive and non-recursive functions to perform the following searching operations for a Key value in a given list of integers:
1) Linear Search
2) Binary Search
### Description:
1) Linear Search : 
- It is also known as sequential search .we start searching for the target from the
 beginning of the list, and we continue until  we find the target or
 until we are sure that it is not in the list.
- In this search, elements in the list need not be ordered.
 
2) Binary Search :
- It starts by testing the data in the element at the middle of the list.
 This determines if the target is in first half or second half of the list.
 If it is in first half , we do not need to check the second half.
 If it is in second half , we do not need to check the first half.
 In other words ,either way we eliminate half the list from further
 consideration
- In this search ,elements in the list need to be ordered.
- This type of search takes less time to execute
