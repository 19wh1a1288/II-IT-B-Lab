## Aim of the experiment:
Write a program that use both recursive and non-recursive functions to perform the following searching operations for a Key value in a given list of integers:
1) Linear Search
2) Binary Search
### Description:
1) Linear Search : It is also known as sequential search .we start searching for the target from the
 beginning of the list, and we continue until  we find the target or
 until we are sure that it is not in the list.
