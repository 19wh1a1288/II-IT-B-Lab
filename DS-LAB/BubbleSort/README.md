### Aim of the Experiment:
Write a program that implements bubble sorting method to sort a given list of integers in ascending order

### Description:
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
- It is also known as sinking sort
- It compares the first two elements, and if the first is greater than the second, it
swaps them.
- It continues doing this for each pair of adjacent elements to the end of the data set.
- It then starts again with the first two elements.
- Repeating until no swaps have occurred on the last pass
- If we have n number of elements then we will have n-1 number of passes

### Step by step procedure:
