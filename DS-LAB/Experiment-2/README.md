### Aim of the experiment:
Write a program using recursive functions to perform the following searching operations for a Key value in a given list of integers:
- Linear Search
### Description:
Linear Search :
- It is also known as sequential search .we start searching for the target from the beginning of the list, and we continue until we find the target or until we are sure that it is not in the list.
- In this search, elements in the list need not be ordered.
### Step by step procedure:
- Firstle we declare a function RecLinearSearch which takes 4 parameters.
### Output obtained:
- Output 1 Key Value : 99

- Output 2 Key Value : 15
